# William & Mary Portfolio
This is a portfolio of projects and work I did during my undergraduate degree at William &amp; Mary.

### Summer 2020 Monroe Research  
This was a small research project I did with James Monroe Scholar funding from the William & Mary Charles Center. The project looked at players drafted in Major League Baseball's amateur drafts out of high school and attempted to predict if they would sign a contract. The folder includes:
- A Jupyter notebook for data cleaning and descriptive analysis  
- A Jupyter notebook for basic modeling and prediction  
- A CSV of the cleaned data returned from the Jupyter Notebook
- A list of players drafted in the 2020 MLB draft (which was Covid-19 affected)
- The final report submitted for the project  

### RBG Tweets Project
This was a project I did for DATA 440- Data Science for the Social Sciences and Humanities in the Fall 2020 semester. For the project, I looked at sentiment analysis of tweets from immediately before and after the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, subsetted on religious, and gender keywords, to explore the sentiment around her death and how it related to her identity. The folder includes:
- A Jupyter notebook for all  data collection and cleaning and sentiment analysis
- A CSV file containing every tweet ID hydrated in the project (this is too big for Github but is accessible at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aYAaslvd8R_ZB2PRZ-ZOU-pS-QfkfdFA/view?usp=sharing)
- The final report for the project

### College Football Networks
This was a project I did for DATA 340- Social Network Analysis in the Spring 2022 semester. For the project, I looked at FBS schedule and standings data to explore which teams were "most central" to the FBS in the years of the College Football Playoff. The folder includes:
- A jupyter notebook for Data Cleaning, Network Analysis, and Visualization
- Two visualization GIFs year-to-year: One by team, the other by conference
- A folder for the Schedule data and a folder for the Standings data (pre-cleaning)
- A slidedeck for presentation
- A poster (also attached to the end of the slide deck), which was the main deliverable for the project

### Keystroke Dynamics Project
This was a project I did for CSCI 688, a graduate course in AI & Cybersecurity I took during Spring 2022. For the project, I did a literature analysis of current advancements in Keystroke Dynamics in the field of cybersecurity. The project also included a preliminary idea for a future independent research project on visualizing keystroke dynamics data and using Neural Networks for classification of individuals using keystroke dynamics for features.
