# William & Mary Portfolio
This is a portfolio of projects and work I did during my undergraduate degree at William &amp; Mary.

### Summer 2020 Monroe Research  
This was a small research project I did with James Monroe Scholar funding from the William & Mary Charles Center. The project looked at players drafted in Major League Baseball's amateur drafts out of high school and attempted to predict if they would sign a contract. The folder includes:
- A Jupyter notebook for data cleaning and descriptive analysis.  
- A Jupyter notebook for basic modeling and prediction.  
- A CSV of the cleaned data returned from the Jupyter Notebook.
- A list of players drafted in the 2020 MLB draft (which was Covid-19 affected).
- The final report submitted for the project.
